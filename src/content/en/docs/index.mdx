# What is Platform & Administration in Applivery?

Platform & Administration centralizes all the controls for managing your organization: workspaces, roles and permissions, billing, branding, and global security settings. Administrators have full visibility over users, usage, and platform configuration to maintain compliance and operational efficiency.
