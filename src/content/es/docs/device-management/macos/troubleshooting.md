Common areas to investigate:

- Enrollment errors (profile installation, UAMDM approval)
- Policy application failures (FileVault, Gatekeeper, firewall)
- App deployment and update conflicts
- Profile payload conflicts and priority issues

Use logs (`system.log`, MDM client logs), test accounts, and staged rollouts to isolate problems.
