Manual enrollment lets users or administrators enroll macOS devices without ABM/ASM assignment. It is common in BYOD or pilot scenarios.

Steps:

- Navigate to the MDM enrollment URL and download the profile
- Install and approve the profile to grant management capabilities
- Verify device appears in the MDM and apply initial policies

Tips:

- Provide clear instructions and prerequisites (admin rights, network access)
- Use lightweight baseline profiles to avoid friction during pilots
- Monitor compliance and prompt users to enable critical security controls
