Gatekeeper helps protect macOS by enforcing code signing and notarization. Configure policies to:

- Allow apps from the App Store and identified developers
- Enforce notarization for downloaded apps
- Balance security with developer workflows in controlled environments

Regularly review exceptions to avoid expanding the attack surface.
