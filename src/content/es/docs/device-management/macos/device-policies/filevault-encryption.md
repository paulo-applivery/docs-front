FileVault provides full‑disk encryption on macOS. Use MDM to enforce enablement and escrow recovery keys:

- Require FileVault at first login and set key escrow
- Configure institutional keys if applicable
- Provide recovery processes and test them regularly

Ensure users understand the impact and have secure recovery options.
