# What is Endpoint Management or Device Management?  
Endpoint Management is a unified platform that allows organizations to enroll, configure, secure, and monitor all corporate devices—mobile, tablets, and computers—from one centralized dashboard. It automates provisioning, app deployment, and policy enforcement to ensure security and reduce IT workload.
